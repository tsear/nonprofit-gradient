==== Nonprofit Gradient — Smart Grant Intelligence Dashboard ====
		
  		Built by Smart Grant Solutions

A pragmatic system for surfacing high-priority nonprofit leads and visualizing the philanthropic landscape.

⸻

🚀 Project Overview

This project combines public IRS Form 990 data with machine learning-driven prioritization to help teams:
	•	Understand the nonprofit sector at scale
 
	•	Identify ideal prospects by revenue, sector, and mission alignment
 
	•	Visualize momentum, financial capacity, and organizational focus
 
	•	Export filtered, high-signal lead lists for outreach

What started as a data-cleaning experiment evolved into a purpose-built sales intelligence dashboard. It helps our internal teams (and now, others) find, rank, and connect with high-opportunity nonprofit organizations.

⸻

🎯 Goals

	•	Collect + normalize IRS 990 data for thousands of nonprofits
 
	•	Score organizations across multiple axes (e.g., revenue, volatility, program %)
 
	•	Expose insights through clean, interpretable visualizations
 
	•	Filter and export high-priority orgs by custom criteria
 
	•	Enable anyone to run the dashboard locally with minimal technical skill

⸻

🛠 Tools & Stack

	•	Python 3.10+
 
	•	Pandas for data manipulation
 
	•	Plotly for interactive charts
 
	•	scikit-learn for clustering + scaling
 
	•	Streamlit for dashboard front-end
 
	•	Matplotlib + Seaborn for exploratory visuals (now deprecated in favor of Plotly)
 
	•	Data source: IRS 990 filings + internal enrichment pipelines

⸻

📈 Dashboard Highlights

	•	✅ Interactive filters: Sector, ZIP, revenue, momentum, etc.
 
	•	✅ Export filtered orgs to CSV
 
	•	✅ Pre-clustered organizations using KMeans
 
	•	✅ Top 10 leaderboard based on priority + financial strength
 
	•	✅ Sector/Flag breakdown visualizations (minimal but insightful)

🔍 Understanding the Dashboard

Each element in the dashboard has been built to surface actionable insight while remaining interpretable. Below is a breakdown of how to read and use each one:

📋 Explore the Filtered Organizations

A dynamic data table of nonprofits based on your filter selections. Sorted by PRIORITY_SCORE.

Key Columns:

	•	ORG_NAME: Name of the nonprofit
 
	•	REVENUE: Reported total revenue (capped view at $200M by default)
 
	•	SECTOR: Organizational focus area
 
	•	PRIORITY_SCORE: Our internal ranking metric based on multiple financial & strategic factors
 
	•	MOMENTUM_CLASS: Velocity of growth based on multi-year behavior

Use this to scan for high-scoring orgs in your sector or ZIP. Use the “Download CSV” button to export a list for outreach.

⸻

📊 Target Flag Distribution by Sector

Shows how many organizations within each sector are classified under different TARGET_FLAG categories (e.g., “High Potential”, “Monitor”, etc.).
This helps visualize which sectors are underexplored or saturated.

⸻

🔥 Momentum Watchlist by Sector & Class

Grouped bar chart showing average momentum scores across sectors and growth classes.

	•	X-axis: Sector
 
	•	Y-axis: Momentum Score (clipped between -0.5 and 1.5)
 
	•	Color: Momentum class

Most nonprofits have stable or negative momentum; positive surges are rare. This chart helps surface potential growth orgs hidden in underperforming sectors.

⸻

🚨 Excluded Orgs Over $200M Revenue

A secondary table listing orgs excluded from the main view due to extreme revenue skew. These are still valuable to inspect but were removed to avoid biasing visualizations and metrics.

⸻

🎛 Filter Logic & Guidance

Each filter works on its own or in combination with others:

	•	Sector: Choose one or more mission areas
 
	•	ZIP: Enter prefix to filter by geography
 
	•	Revenue: View ranges from $0 to $200M
 
	•	Priority Score: Higher is better
 
	•	Target Flag: Our internal classification schema
 
	•	Momentum Class: Indicates trajectory or trend

🧰 How to Run This Yourself (Even If You’re Not a Developer)

Requirements: Python 3.10+ installed

	1.	Clone this repo
 
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nonprofit-gradient.git
cd nonprofit-gradient

	2.	Set up a virtual environment
 
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

	3.	Install dependencies
 
pip install -r requirements.txt

	4.	Run the dashboard
 
streamlit run app/ui_dashboard.py

This will launch the dashboard in your browser where you can explore and export filtered orgs.

👀 Results & Insights

We found the most actionable nonprofit leads:

	•	Operate with high program-to-revenue ratios
 
	•	Belong to emerging or underfunded sectors
 
	•	Are financially mature (>$10M revenue) but unflagged
 
	•	Cluster in key ZIPs indicating outreach potential

Over 25,000 orgs were processed and scored. All logic is reproducible and transparent.
