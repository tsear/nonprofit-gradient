# ðŸ§  Nonprofit Gradient â€” Smart Grant Intelligence Dashboard

**Built by Smart Grant Solutions**  
_A pragmatic system for surfacing high-priority nonprofit leads and visualizing the philanthropic landscape._

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project combines public IRS Form 990 data with machine learning-driven prioritization to help teams:
- Understand the nonprofit sector at scale
- Identify ideal prospects by revenue, sector, and mission alignment
- Visualize momentum, financial capacity, and organizational focus
- Export filtered, high-signal lead lists for outreach

What started as a data-cleaning experiment evolved into a purpose-built sales intelligence dashboard. It helps our internal teams (and now, others) find, rank, and connect with high-opportunity nonprofit organizations.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- **Collect + normalize** IRS 990 data for thousands of nonprofits
- **Score** organizations across multiple axes (e.g., revenue, volatility, program %)
- **Expose insights** through clean, interpretable visualizations
- **Filter and export** high-priority orgs by custom criteria
- **Enable anyone** to run the dashboard locally with minimal technical skill

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Stack

- `Python 3.10+`
- `Pandas` for data manipulation
- `Plotly` for interactive charts
- `scikit-learn` for clustering + scaling
- `Streamlit` for dashboard front-end
- `Matplotlib` + `Seaborn` for exploratory visuals (now deprecated in favor of Plotly)
- Data source: IRS 990 filings + internal enrichment pipelines

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Highlights

- âœ… Interactive filters: Sector, ZIP, revenue, momentum, etc.
- âœ… Export filtered orgs to CSV
- âœ… Pre-clustered organizations using KMeans
- âœ… Top 10 leaderboard based on priority + financial strength
- âœ… Sector/Flag breakdown visualizations (minimal but insightful)

ðŸ‘€ Results & Insights

We found that the most actionable nonprofit leads:
	â€¢	Have high program-to-revenue ratios (indicating operational focus)
	â€¢	Sit in underrepresented sectors with strong average scores
	â€¢	Are financially capable (revenue > $10M) but not yet flagged internally
	â€¢	Exist in regional clusters that warrant geographically-focused outreach

Over 25,000 organizations were analyzed. All scoring logic is transparent and reproducible.

This tool leverages public IRS filings (Form 990) and internal scoring metrics. It is a research and prioritization tool, not a definitive indicator of organizational value or eligibility. Use it to surface strong leads, but always validate manually before engagement.
